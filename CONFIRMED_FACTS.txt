CONFIRMED FACTS ONLY:

1. Chattynator.API.AddModifier() successfully registers our function
2. Our modifier IS being called on every chat message
3. The data object has data.text and data.typeInfo.player.name fields
4. data.typeInfo.player.name contains player name with realm (e.g., "Borkthebrave-Doomhowl")
5. data.text DOES contain hyperlink codes - byte dump proves it
   Example bytes: |Hplayer:Borkthebrave-Doomhowl:1011:CHANNEL:3|h
   When printed as string, debug frame RENDERS the hyperlinks so they appear as plain text
6. CPL level cache works and returns levels for players
7. Our pattern matching has not successfully modified any text yet

EUREKA DISCOVERY:
The text appearing as "T. Borkthebrave: [..] message" is the RENDERED output.
The ACTUAL data.text contains: "|Hchannel:...|hT.|h |Hplayer:Borkthebrave-Doomhowl:...|h|cffc79..."
This is why our patterns failed - we were looking at rendered output but matching against raw hyperlink codes.

Everything else has been assumption.
